  # We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
  # choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little
  # resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
  # lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.

  # How often (in seconds) to perform the probe. Default to 10 seconds. Minimum value is 1.

  # Number of seconds after which the probe times out. Defaults to 1 second. Minimum value is 1.

  # Minimum consecutive successes for the probe to be considered successful after having failed. Defaults to 1. Must be 1 for liveness. Minimum value is 1.
  successThreshold: 1
  # When a Pod starts and the probe fails, Kubernetes will try failureThreshold times before giving up. Giving up in case of liveness probe means restarting the Pod. In case of readiness probe the Pod will be marked Unready. Defaults to 3. Minimum value is 1.
